# 🍔 Kraving — Food Ordering Web App (MERN Prototype)

Kraving is a **full-stack MERN food ordering web application prototype** that demonstrates how a real-world food ordering platform works at a basic level.

This project focuses on **core web-app functionality** such as authentication, browsing items, cart management, checkout, and order history — without unnecessary complexity.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This is a **prototype / learning project**, not a production-ready application.  
> It implements only the **essential features** that most web apps contain.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Kraving simulates the **end-to-end user flow** of a food ordering application:

1. User signs up or logs in
2. User browses food items
3. User adds items to cart (with quantity & size)
4. User checks out
5. User views previous orders

This makes the project suitable for:
- Learning the MERN stack
- Hackathons
- Portfolio projects
- Understanding frontend–backend integration
